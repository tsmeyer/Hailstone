The "Hailstone" problem is UNSOLVED in mathematics!  Awesome.  It goes like this:

0.  Give me an odd number (positive).
1.  Multiply by 3 and add 1.

This new number has to be even.

2.  Divide this even number by two as many times as you can until the result becomes odd.  At that point stop, and that odd number becomes the new input.

3.  If this new input == 1 then halt; otherwise go to step 1.

= = = = =

Here's the deal: every # you try ALWAYS goes to "1" eventually.  But no one has proved that that will always happen.
